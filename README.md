# cliopatra

This is a fork of the [original cliopatra on cljars][0].

It is based on a more updated version of [tools.cli][1] (version 1.0.219 to be specific).

Otherwise, it's more or less the same as the original.  

I could not find the original source code on GitHub.

## LICENSE

I could not asertain what the original license to [cliopatra][0] was; currently, for this fork, I've used the [ISC License][2].
